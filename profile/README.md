Lexsi Labs drives Aligned and Safe AI Frontier Research. Our goal is to build AI systems that are transparent, reliable, and value-aligned, combining interpretability, alignment, and governance to enable trustworthy intelligence at scale.  


### Research Focus  
- **Aligned & Safe AI:** Frameworks for self-monitoring, interpretable, and alignment-aware systems.  
- **Explainability & Alignment:** Faithful, architecture-agnostic interpretability and value-aligned optimization across tabular, vision, and language models.  
- **Safe Behaviour Control:** Techniques for fine-tuning, pruning, and behavioural steering in large models.  
- **Risk & Governance:** Continuous monitoring, drift detection, and fairness auditing for responsible deployment.  
- **Tabular & LLM Research:** Foundational work on tabular intelligence, in-context learning, and interpretable large language models.
